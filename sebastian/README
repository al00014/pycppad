INSTALLATION:
=============
Requirements:

* Python and Numpy, both with header files
* boost::python

On Debian/Ubuntu this should work:
sudo apt-get install python python-dev python-numpy libboost-python-dev

Rename the setup.py.example to setup.py and adapt it to your needs,
i.e. set the paths to CppAD, Boost and Python if you have installed it in a non-standard place. 

Build the extension. Below is a sample what it should look like:


RUN EXAMPLES:
=============
python examples/simple_examples.py


UNIT TESTS:
===========
For that you need py.test

Download from http://codespeak.net/py/dist/
or  sudo apt-get install python-codespeak-lib

run with the following command
py.test unit_tests/general_test.py
